       2. You can load a template in many ways. For convenience, we'll include it in
       a script tag so that we don't need to mess around with AJAX or multiline strings.
       Note that we've set the type attribute to 'text/ractive' - though it can be
       just about anything except 'text/javascript'

  <div id="prev_container"></div>
  {% raw %}
  <script id='template' type='text/ractive'>
    <p>Hello, {{name}}!</p>
  </script>
  {% endraw %}
  <script>
    var ractive = new Ractive({
      // The `el` option can be a node, an ID, or a CSS selector.
      el: '#container',

      // We could pass in a string, but for the sake of convenience
      // we're passing the ID of the <script> tag above.
      template: '#template',

      // Here, we're passing in some initial data
      data: { name: 'world' }
    });
